Complete Bug List
==================
Problem #1: Q10 returns no rows
	Since orders can only be returned (l_returnflag = 'R') after they 
	have been received, and can't be received in the future, the
	number of permissible orders for query 10 tails off early in
	1995. If you are lucky enough to get a parameter substitution
	after February '95 (allowed in 2.12.3), things can go "quickly".
    SEVERITY:
    SPEC FIX: replace 2.12.3 (1) with "DATE is the first day in a
	rundomly selected month between the first month of 1993 and the
	last month of 1994"
    DBGEN FIX: change permisible substitution range for query 10, 
	parameter 1
    ANSWER SETS: not effected.
    STATUS: closed
    WORKAROUND: use a different seed for qgen parameter substitution
    HELP NEEDED:
    AUDITORS NOTIFIED:	
    OPENED AGAINST: 1.0
    CLOSED IN:      1.0.1 (dbgen and qgen)

Problem #2: parallelism in load to gen differing data sets
         the parallel load code was based on extensible data sets; since
	 each "extension" made an assumption of scale factor, the data
	 could end up clustered. Further, since the RNG is
	 self-modifying, different numbers of extension led to different
	 final data sets.
    SEVERITY:
    SPEC FIX: none.
    DBGEN FIX: remove -E(xtensible) option and implement pure parallel
               load with a known scale factor; rebuild seed files
    ANSWER SETS: not effected. (parallelism not implemented for SF <= 1)
    STATUS: closed
    WORKAROUND: don't use the parallel load (-C) option to DBGEN
    HELP NEEDED: testers needed.
    AUDITORS NOTIFIED:	yes.

Problem #3: some arithmetic tends to overflow at large SF
         retailprice tends to SF/10 as SF increases. this can lead to
	 data corruption in extendedprice and aggregate calculations
    SEVERITY:
    SPEC FIX: will need rework of 1.3 wrt retailprice calculation
    DBGEN FIX: modification to second term of rpb_routine() calcuation
               to limit contibution of second term to the maximum seen at 
	       SF=.1
    ANSWER SETS: not effected

Problem #5: QGEN seed init inconsistent
