/**
 * Class that encapsulate the set of parameters that characterize hyper parameters of a theta-join.
 * _height and _width represent the estimated sizes of both input relations of the theta-join.
 * The goal of defining this matrix is to determine the assignment of the theta-join to a set of workers,
 * based on a partitioning of the matrix. 
 * Once we get a partition of the matrix, each workers can be assign one part of it. 
 * A good partition would be one which balance the area assigned to each worker (load balancing),
 * and in which the area of each part is as close as possible to a square, (minimizing network utilisation).
