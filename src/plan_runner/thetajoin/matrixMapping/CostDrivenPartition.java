/**
 *  This class implements a partitioning algorithm. 
 *  The idea here is to start by assigning all the matrix to a single worker. 
 *  Thus the entire matrix becomes the work unit for this worker. Then, while 
 *  there are additional workers, we use them to distribute the 
 *  total work of the theta-join operation. We distribute the work among the 
 *  workers using this scheme:
 *  	A) If the worker-unit has height > width, add a whole row of workers,
 *  	B) If the worker-unit has height < width, add a whole column of workers,
 *    	C) If there are not enough workers for an entire row/column, add the remaining
 *    		to the first row/column depending on if the cells have height>width or 
 *    		vice-versa. Then, re-adjust the cell boundaries so that all cells 
 *    		cover the same are. 
 *    		 
 *  For each design point visited, the cost for that partition scheme is noted. Then, 
 *  we iterate over all the costs before choosing the best option.
 *  
 *  In the end, if we used the option C) we also check to see if the cell boundary 
 *  re-adjustment should be done to balance the communication cost for each cell. 
 *  We consider this cost option too before deciding the best partition.
